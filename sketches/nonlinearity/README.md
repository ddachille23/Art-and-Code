Don't Kill the Celiac is an interactive text adventure set in the Amherst Big Y supermarket. The user needs to find the gluten-free versions of the items on their shopping list before time runs out! As the user grows frustrated by their struggle to find gluten-free items, they begin to get a taste of what it's like to be a celiac in real life. The game also serves as an educational tool, teaching the player which foods are safe for celiacs and which are dangerous.
