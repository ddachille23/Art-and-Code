**Title:** Geometric Sunlight

**Description:** Geometric Sunglight is a computer-generated art piece inspired by the sun's rays. Begin with your eyes on the bottom right corner of the frame, focusing on the sharp edges of the repeating squares. Let your eyes naturally wander up and to the left and you'll notice a three-dimensional effect.
