**Title:** Hypnotic Weave

**Description:** “Hypnotic Weave” is an animated art piece inspired by the loud design of casino carpets. These carpets are deliberately designed to keep players in the casino for longer periods of time so that they spend more money. The piece captivates the viewer through its mesmerizing movement of patterns, inducing a trance-like state that makes time appear to slip away effortlessly. “Hypnotic Weave” offers an immersive experience that evokes the sense of being lost in a world of chance and uncertainty, much like the casino itself.
