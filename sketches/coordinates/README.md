My Title: The Chaotic Forest

Original Painting Title: The Turning Road by Andre Derain

Description: The Chaotic Forest is a digital reinterpretation of Andre Derainâ€™s The Turning Road. The work incorporates the same vibrant blues, greens, and reds as the original piece while adding original elements such as fractal trees and a patterned background. I aimed to create a sense of depth in the image by layering shapes and using repeating circles that get larger as they approach the foreground.
