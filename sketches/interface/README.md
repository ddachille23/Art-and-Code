**Title:** BlindBrush: A painting program for the blind

**Description:** Think Microsoft Paint but for blind people. Before drawing, close your eyes and turn your volume up. Next, select a color and shape option. Find the center of the artboard by listening for the deepest, bassiest sound, and the corners by listening for the highest pitch sound. Once you are oriented, you can start drawing! (headphones recommended)

Other Instructions: 
- Sound Library Required: Steps to Install (in the python processing IDE)
  - Sketch (in the top bar) → Import Library… → Add Library… → Search “Sound” at the top → Select the one that says “Sound | Provides a simple way to work with audio” → Click “Install” on the bottom right → Close pop up window and run the code!
