**Title:** Chaotic Crossing

**Description:** "Chaotic Crossing" is a virtual simulation that mimics the real-world experience of the Shibuya Crossing in Japan. The simulation features pedestrians who are programmed to be attracted to the people on the other side of the crosswalk, creating a chaotic and unpredictable pattern of movement. The art piece aims to explore emergent behavior through the interactions between agents and their environment, highlighting how seemingly small and simple rules can lead to complex and unexpected outcomes.
